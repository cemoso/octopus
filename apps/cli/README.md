# @octopus/cli

The Octopus CLI. Built with [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) (React for terminals), distributed as a **native single binary** (Bun-compiled). No Node, no npm install, no runtime dependencies.

Replaces the previous npm-published `@octp/cli` package — different distribution model, more features.

## Install

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octopusreview/octopus/master/apps/cli/install/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/octopusreview/octopus/master/apps/cli/install/install.ps1 | iex
```

Both installers:

1. Detect your OS + CPU architecture
2. Fetch the latest `octp-v*` release from GitHub
3. Download the matching binary
4. Install it to `~/.octopus/bin/octp` (override with `OCTOPUS_INSTALL_DIR`)
5. Print a one-liner to add the install directory to your `PATH` (or update it directly on Windows)

Environment variables both installers respect:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `OCTOPUS_INSTALL_DIR` | Override install directory |
| `OCTOPUS_INSTALL_REPO` | Override the GitHub repo (e.g. for forks) |
| `OCTOPUS_INSTALL_TAG` | Pin a specific tag instead of fetching latest |

## Commands

```
octp                       Launch the onboarding wizard (first run) or dashboard
octp onboard [--reset]     Run the onboarding wizard explicitly
octp review [--staged]     Review local changes before opening a PR
                           --staged: only diff what's in the staging index
                           --since <ref>: diff from <ref> instead of HEAD
                           --index: index the working tree for context-aware review
                           --no-index: skip the index prompt, review in bare mode
octp agent serve           Start the local-agent bridge for Ollama / Claude CLI
octp doctor                Environment + auth health check
octp config <get|set>      Manage ~/.octopus/config.json               (coming soon)
octp --version | -v        Print version
octp --help | -h           Print this help
```

The first invocation of bare `octp` triggers the onboarding wizard:

1. **Welcome** — what Octopus is, in three sentences
2. **Auth** — sign in to the hosted Octopus account *or* point at a self-hosted instance
3. **Org** — pick the organisation context (hosted only)
4. **Provider** — pick which AI provider runs the review (Claude / OpenAI / Google / Cohere; with Workstream 5 also Grok / ACPX / OpenCode / Ollama)
5. **Model** — pick a model from the chosen provider
6. **BYOK** — enter the API key (or skip and use the org's platform key)
7. **Validate** — live API ping to confirm the key works
8. **Repo install** — pick a GitHub repo and install the Octopus App (hosted only)
9. **Done** — summary of what was configured + next steps

Each step is small, has phase-state (`running | done | failed | skipped`), and follows the same footer convention: `Enter to continue · Esc to skip · Left to go back`.

## Set up a repository with your AI

Give the [homepage setup prompt](https://octopus-review.ai/#agent-setup) to the
coding agent already working on your project.

This requires a CLI and server version that include agent onboarding. Older
servers return an explicit unsupported-server error; use the
[CLI setup guide](https://octopus-review.ai/docs/cli) for those installations.

```bash
octp onboard --agent --json
# Explicit GitHub target, with a named Octopus account:
octp --account work onboard --agent --json --repo owner/repository
```

The command runs without a TTY and returns one JSON result per invocation.
`schemaVersion` is `1`. `state`, `completed`, `nextAction` and `continueWith`
tell the agent what to do next. Commands are argument arrays, so the agent
should execute them as arguments without interpolating them into a shell.
Respect `retryAfterSeconds` between status checks.
Exit codes: **0** ready, **3** waiting or approval required, **2** invalid input,
**1** failed. Exit 3 is an expected handoff, not a command failure.

The first run detects the GitHub repository from the current remote. Authentication
uses `octp login --no-open`, which prints the approval URL and waits for the
user. The agent keeps that login process running until it finishes, then resumes
onboarding. Login credentials stay in the existing account store.

For repository access, the command returns the signed GitHub App installation
link or the existing installation's repository settings link. Once access is
available, Octopus imports the target repository and the agent follows indexing
and analysis. Re-running setup reads live server status; completed work is reused.
Failed jobs remain failed for inspection instead of being retried automatically.
Deliberately removed repositories require a restore decision.
If work fails or makes no progress for ten minutes, report the exact state and
continuation command. Opening an approval link does not prove setup completed.

The first version supports github.com repositories, including self-hosted Octopus
servers with a configured GitHub App. It keeps existing organisation model and
billing defaults. It does not configure GitLab/Bitbucket, persist an in-flight login
across a terminated login process, or make existing server analysis jobs durable
across server restarts. An organisation owner's pending GitHub approval is described
at the approval step; the command cannot independently distinguish it from an
installation that has not yet been completed.

## Persistence

State lives under `$OCTOPUS_HOME` (default `~/.octopus/`) in three files, all mode `0600` in a mode `0700` directory:

| File | Purpose | Safe to cat? |
|---|---|---|
| `config.json` | Versioned prefs (chosen provider/model, defaults). Presence of `onboardedAt` gates first-run. | Yes |
| `byok.json` | Provider API keys, separated from prefs. | No |
| `credentials` | Auth tokens for the hosted Octopus account. | No |

A corrupt or unreadable `config.json` is treated as missing — the onboarding wizard re-runs instead of crashing.

## Opt-outs

- `OCTOPUS_NO_ONBOARD=1` — permanent skip (env var)
- `--skip-onboard` — one-shot skip (CLI flag)
- `--reset` — re-runs the wizard, pre-seeding existing config

## Build from source

```bash
cd apps/cli
bun install
bun run dev                       # run from source in your terminal
bun run build:compile             # cross-compile all 5 native targets to dist/
bun run build:compile:darwin-arm64  # single target
bun test                          # run unit tests
```

Cross-compile targets:

| Asset | Platform |
|---|---|
| `octp-linux-x64` | Linux Intel/AMD |
| `octp-linux-arm64` | Linux ARM (Raspberry Pi, AWS Graviton) |
| `octp-darwin-x64` | macOS Intel |
| `octp-darwin-arm64` | macOS Apple Silicon |
| `octp-windows-x64.exe` | Windows Intel/AMD |

## Releases

Tagging `octp-v<semver>` on the upstream repo triggers `.github/workflows/octp-release.yml`, which cross-compiles all five binaries, generates SHA256 checksums, and publishes a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes. The install scripts always fetch the latest tagged release.

```bash
# bump apps/cli/package.json version first, commit, then:
git tag octp-v0.1.0
git push origin octp-v0.1.0
```

## Status

The onboarding wizard, `octp review`, `octp agent serve`, and `octp doctor`
all ship. Only `octp config <get|set>` is still on the roadmap — set
config values via the wizard (`octp onboard --reset`) until then.
