        text: `Q: What is Octopus?
A: Octopus is an AI-powered code review tool that connects to GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Forgejo, indexes your codebase for deep context, and automatically reviews every pull request (and GitLab merge request) — posting findings as inline comments with severity levels.

Q: How does the automated review work?
A: When a pull request is opened, Octopus fetches the diff, retrieves relevant context from your indexed codebase using vector search, and sends it to an LLM (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, xAI Grok, Alibaba Qwen, or any model on OpenRouter) for analysis. Findings are posted directly on the PR with severity ratings: Critical, Major, Minor, Suggestion, and Tip.

Q: Which programming languages are supported?
A: Octopus is language-agnostic. It reviews any text-based code file — TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, and more.

Q: Is my source code safe?
A: Octopus reads repository content to index and review your code. Configured AI services process code and review context. Self-hosting Forgejo does not change this. Self-hosted Octopus with local AI services lets you keep processing on your infrastructure. See the security overview and data-retention documentation for storage details.

Q: Does Octopus replace human reviewers?
A: No. Octopus augments your team's review process. It catches bugs, security issues, and style inconsistencies so your human reviewers can focus on architecture, design decisions, and business logic.

Q: Is there a free tier?
A: Yes! Every organization gets free credits to start. You can also bring your own API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Alibaba Cloud Model Studio, Cohere) to avoid credit costs entirely.`,

No public Forgejo address, tunnel or connector inbound port is needed. Code and review context still reach Cloud and the configured AI services. /docs/integrations#forgejo-cloud-private.
3. Self-hosted Octopus + private LAN/VPN: connect directly from your own Octopus web application and review workers.

1. In your dedicated Forgejo account, open Settings > Applications and create a personal access token with read:user, write:repository and write:issue, choosing All (public, private, and limited). Keep this separate token on your connector machine as FORGEJO_TOKEN. Give the account admin access only to the intended repositories; instance administrator access is unnecessary.
2. As an Octopus organization owner or admin, open /settings/integrations#forgejo in Octopus Cloud. Choose Private network connector, enter the exact HTTPS Forgejo origin and click Create connector, then Copy connector token. Save this one-time token as OCTOPUS_CONNECTOR_TOKEN.
3. On that machine, create a protected connector.env file with OCTOPUS_URL=https://octopus-review.ai, OCTOPUS_CONNECTOR_TOKEN, FORGEJO_URL and FORGEJO_TOKEN (chmod 600). Start the connector with docker run using --env-file connector.env, --restart unless-stopped, --stop-timeout 120 and --read-only; publish no ports. Copyable commands: /docs/integrations#forgejo-cloud-private. Container DNS/VPN routes must reach Forgejo, not just the host browser. Verified HTTPS is required; localhost, loopback, link-local, metadata addresses, redirects and HTTP are blocked. For an internal CA, set NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS to a mounted trusted PEM file and keep certificate verification enabled.
4. Return to Octopus Settings > Integrations > Forgejo, click Refresh status and wait for Connector online, then click Sync repositories.
5. In each Forgejo repository, open Settings > Webhooks > Add Webhook > Forgejo. Copy Target URL and Webhook secret from Octopus; use POST and application/json. Under Trigger on choose Custom events… > Pull request events, selecting Modification and Synchronized. Also select Comments in that same group for PR commands. Keep Active checked and save the webhook. Forgejo sends these webhooks directly to Octopus Cloud.
6. Follow /docs/integrations#forgejo-cloud-private for repository readiness and your first PR, with automatic preparation. Keep the connector running for indexing and reviews.
Rotating the connector credential invalidates the old one; update the local configuration and restart. Docker users must recreate the container with the env file; docker restart does not reload it. An uncertain write result pauses the connector; inspect Forgejo before selecting Resume after checking Forgejo. The uncertain write is not automatically replayed. Consumed response payloads are cleared immediately; payload-free publication recovery metadata stays until acknowledgement, with renewable 60-second leases capped at two hours. Failed or expired metadata is eligible for deletion after five minutes; the reconciliation hold remains until an administrator resumes the connector. Disconnecting deactivates repositories.

    title: "Octopus FAQ",
    sections: [
      {
        heading: "General",
        text: `Q: What is Octopus?
A: Octopus is a source-available, AI-powered code review tool that indexes your codebase and automatically reviews pull requests with context-aware findings.

Q: How does Octopus review code?
A: When a PR is opened, Octopus fetches the diff, retrieves relevant code context via vector search, and uses an LLM (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, xAI Grok, Alibaba Qwen, or any model on OpenRouter) to analyze changes. Findings are posted as inline PR comments.

Q: What languages does Octopus support?
A: Octopus is language-agnostic. It supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, Scala, C, C++, Vue, Svelte, Astro, HTML, CSS, SQL, GraphQL, and more.

Q: How is Octopus different from human reviewers?
A: Octopus augments human review. It catches bugs, security issues, and style problems so humans can focus on architecture and design.

Q: How is Octopus different from linters?
A: Linters check syntax and formatting rules. Octopus understands your entire codebase context, catches logic errors, security vulnerabilities, and provides architectural feedback.`,
      },
      {
        heading: "Security & Privacy",
        text: `Q: Is my code safe?
A: Octopus reads repository content for indexing and reviews, and configured AI services process code and review context. This also applies to self-hosted Forgejo connected to Octopus Cloud. See the security overview and data-retention documentation for storage details.

Q: Can I self-host Octopus?
A: Yes. Octopus is fully self-hostable with Docker. External AI services still receive code when configured. Use local services for processing that must stay on your infrastructure.

Q: Which AI models are used?
A: Claude (Anthropic), OpenAI (GPT), Google Gemini, and Qwen (Alibaba Cloud Model Studio) are all supported review/chat models, selectable per organization — and you can bring your own key for any of them (a Google Gemini API key works for reviews, not just embeddings). OpenAI text-embedding-3-large is used for embeddings. Cohere Rerank is used for search re-ranking.

Q: Is my code used for AI training?
A: Octopus sends code to configured AI services for indexing and reviews. Check each service's current terms and account settings for its data-use policy. Use local services when external processing is not permitted.`,
      },
      {
        heading: "Integrations",
        text: `Q: Which Git platforms are supported?
A: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Forgejo. GitLab supports both GitLab.com and self-managed instances. Forgejo supports Cloud + public HTTPS (direct), Cloud + private LAN/VPN (local connector), or self-hosted Octopus + private LAN/VPN (direct). All use an HTTPS instance, a personal access token and signed repository webhooks. See /docs/integrations#forgejo.

Q: Does Octopus work with Slack?
A: Yes. Use the /octopus command to ask questions about your codebase. You also receive notifications for review events.

Q: Does Octopus integrate with Linear?
A: Yes. Create Linear issues directly from review findings with one click.

Q: Does Octopus integrate with Jira?
A: Yes. Create Jira issues directly from review findings with one click. The issue includes finding details, severity, and a link back to the PR/MR.

Q: Does Octopus support monorepos?
A: Yes. Octopus indexes the entire repository including all packages in a monorepo.

Q: Is there a CLI?
A: Yes. Install with curl -fsSL https://octopus-review.ai/install.sh | bash. Use it to review PRs, chat with your codebase, and manage knowledge.`,
      },
      {
        heading: "Pricing & Billing",
        text: `Q: How does pricing work?
A: Credit-based. AI operations consume credits. Free credits included. Buy more as needed.

Q: Is there a free tier?
A: Yes. Every organization gets free credits. No credit card required.

Q: Can I use my own API keys?
A: Yes. Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK) for Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Alibaba Cloud Model Studio, and Cohere. No credits consumed.

Q: How do spend limits work?
A: Set a monthly cap per organization. Operations are paused when the limit is reached.`,
      },
      {
        heading: "Technical",
        text: `Q: How does codebase indexing work?
A: Octopus clones your repo, chunks code files into 1500-character segments with 200-character overlap, creates embeddings using text-embedding-3-large, and stores them in Qdrant for vector search.

Q: What is the Knowledge Base?
A: A collection of custom documents (guidelines, architecture decisions, coding standards) that Octopus references during reviews to enforce your team's specific rules.

Q: How long does a review take?
A: Most reviews complete in under 2 minutes, depending on the size of the diff and the amount of context retrieved.

Q: Can I customize reviews?
A: Yes. Upload knowledge documents, configure .octopusignore to exclude files, choose your AI provider, and set severity thresholds.

Q: How do real-time updates work?
A: Octopus uses WebSocket connections (via Pubby SDK) to push real-time updates: review progress, chat messages, indexing status, and team activity.`,

        heading: "Terms",
        text: `BYO Keys (Bring Your Own Keys): Use your own API keys for Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Alibaba Cloud Model Studio, or Cohere instead of Octopus credits. Configure in organization settings.

Codebase Indexing: The process of cloning a repository, splitting code into chunks, creating vector embeddings, and storing them in Qdrant for semantic search.

Context Window: The maximum amount of text an LLM can process in a single request. Octopus manages context by retrieving only the most relevant code chunks via vector search.

Credits: The unit of currency in Octopus. AI operations (reviews, chat, indexing) consume credits. Free credits are provided; additional credits can be purchased.

Diff: The set of changes in a pull request — lines added, modified, or removed. Octopus analyzes the diff against full codebase context.

Embeddings: Numerical vector representations of text. Octopus uses OpenAI text-embedding-3-large (3072 dimensions) to create embeddings of code chunks for semantic search.

Knowledge Base: Custom documents uploaded to an organization (coding guidelines, architecture decisions, style guides) that Octopus references during reviews.

LLM (Large Language Model): AI models like Claude (Anthropic), GPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), Grok (xAI) and Qwen (Alibaba) that analyze code and generate review findings.

.octopusignore: A file in your repository root (same syntax as .gitignore) that tells Octopus which files to skip during indexing and review.

Qdrant: The vector database used by Octopus to store and search code embeddings. Collections: code_chunks, knowledge_chunks, review_chunks, chat_chunks, flowchart_chunks.

Reranking: A second-pass ranking step using Cohere Rerank that re-orders search results by relevance to the query, improving the quality of retrieved context.

Severity Levels: Finding priority ratings — 🔴 Critical (security, data loss, or broken functionality; blocks merge), 🟠 Major (bugs, logic errors, performance), 🟡 Minor (code quality, maintainability), 🔵 Suggestion (optional improvement), 💡 Tip (informational).

Spend Limit: A monthly cost cap per organization. When reached, AI operations are paused until the next billing cycle or limit increase.

Vector Search: Semantic search using embeddings. Instead of keyword matching, vector search finds code that is semantically similar to the query, even with different wording.

Webhook: An HTTP callback from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Forgejo that notifies Octopus when events occur (PR/MR opened, PR/MR updated, push). This triggers automatic reviews.`,
