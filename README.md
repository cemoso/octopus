## Getting started

### Octopus Cloud

For GitHub projects, give your coding AI the [homepage setup prompt](https://octopus-review.ai/#agent-setup). It uses the native CLI to set up the repository in your current project; you approve sign-in and GitHub access. See the [CLI guide](https://octopus-review.ai/docs/cli) for installation and agent setup.

To set up through the dashboard instead:

1. [Sign in](https://octopus-review.ai/login) with Google, GitHub, Microsoft or an email magic link.
2. Create your organization, connect GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket or Forgejo, and choose the repositories to review.
3. Follow the dashboard guide: confirm repository readiness, open a pull request or merge request, then wait for the first successfully published review. See the [first-review instructions](https://octopus-review.ai/docs/getting-started).

Forgejo has three connection options:

- [Octopus Cloud + public HTTPS](https://octopus-review.ai/docs/integrations#forgejo-cloud-public): connect directly with a personal access token.
- [Octopus Cloud + private LAN/VPN](https://octopus-review.ai/docs/integrations#forgejo-cloud-private): run the local connector on your network. It connects outward to Octopus Cloud; Forgejo stays private.
- [Self-hosted Octopus + private LAN/VPN](https://octopus-review.ai/docs/integrations#forgejo-self-hosted): connect directly from your own Octopus deployment with the explicit allowed origins.

All three use signed repository webhooks. Octopus and your configured AI services process code for reviews, including when a local connector is used. Hosting Forgejo yourself does not keep Cloud review processing on your network.

### Octopus Self-hosted

Deploy Octopus on infrastructure you manage, with control over configuration and model providers. Follow the [self-hosting guide](https://octopus-review.ai/docs/self-hosting) for Docker Compose, environment setup and migrations, then configure your [GitHub App](https://octopus-review.ai/docs/github-app) or another [code-host integration](https://octopus-review.ai/docs/integrations).

## Features

- **Review where you work:** summaries, inline findings and suggested fixes in GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and Forgejo; [CLI reviews](https://octopus-review.ai/docs/cli) for terminal workflows.
- **Use your team's context:** indexed repository context, knowledge documents, and repo rules in `.octopus.md`, `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Choose your AI provider:** organization-level model settings and support for your own API keys. See [model discovery](docs/model-discovery.md) for catalog updates.
- **Understand the result:** severity levels, category scores and explicit [review coverage](docs/review-coverage.md), including incomplete results.
