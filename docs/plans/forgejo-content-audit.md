# Forgejo connection content audit

Updated: 19 September 2026. Connector baseline: v1.1.0, commit `85d94b190b25a681a0c289af7a94744b8ee4b3c8`.

This audit covers the repository's current website, onboarding emails, help content and machine-readable descriptions. It tracks the v1.2.0 connector changes separately from the direct Forgejo integration shipped in v1.1.0. Source changes and local validation do not establish a deployed release or a completed review against a user's Forgejo installation.

## The three connection paths

The [Forgejo setup chooser](https://octopus-review.ai/docs/integrations#forgejo) is the canonical entry point. It separates these paths before giving credentials or webhook instructions:

| Path | Forgejo access | Forgejo personal access token | Webhook destination |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Octopus Cloud + public HTTPS](https://octopus-review.ai/docs/integrations#forgejo-cloud-public) | Cloud connects directly to a public HTTPS origin | Encrypted in Octopus | Octopus Cloud |
| [Octopus Cloud + private LAN/VPN](https://octopus-review.ai/docs/integrations#forgejo-cloud-private) | Local connector polls Cloud outward and accesses its configured private HTTPS origin | Stays on the connector machine | Forgejo sends directly to Octopus Cloud over outbound HTTPS |
| [Self-hosted Octopus + private LAN/VPN](https://octopus-review.ai/docs/integrations#forgejo-self-hosted) | Web and review workers connect directly with matching routes, DNS and explicit allowed origins | Encrypted in the user's Octopus deployment | The user's Octopus deployment |

The Cloud connector opens no listener and needs no tunnel or public Forgejo URL. Both the connector and Forgejo need outbound HTTPS to Octopus Cloud. Container routing and DNS must work independently of access from the operator's browser. Cloud options send code and review context to Octopus Cloud and configured AI services. The connector does not keep review processing on the private network.

The [self-hosting guide](https://octopus-review.ai/docs/self-hosting#forgejo) owns direct private-network operator configuration. It links Cloud users back to the connector path. Native CLI agent onboarding remains GitHub-only.

## Current content inventory

| Surface | Source | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Setup chooser and three separate instructions | `apps/web/app/(landing)/docs/integrations/page.tsx` | Named anchors, common bot/token prerequisites, actual runner environment and image, Cloud webhook destination, TLS/CA, status, rotation, disconnect and uncertain-write recovery. Shared review-event rules remain explicit. |
| Self-hosted operator guide | `apps/web/app/(landing)/docs/self-hosting/page.tsx` | Direct private access is clearly scoped to self-hosted Octopus; Cloud connector crosslink, origin allowlist, matching workers/DNS, trusted CA and private webhook target rules. |
| Homepage and repository introduction | `apps/web/app/(landing)/page.tsx`, `README.md` | Three connection options and setup links; no private hosting claim that implies local Cloud processing. |
| Dashboard onboarding | `apps/web/components/dashboard/providers-banner.tsx` | Names public direct, Cloud private connector and self-hosted direct access. |
| Settings | `apps/web/app/(app)/settings/integrations/forgejo-integration-card.tsx` | Direct and connector choices, setup link, one-time credential, connection state and management actions. |
| Quickstart and FAQ | `apps/web/app/(landing)/docs/getting-started/page.tsx`, `docs/faq/page.tsx` | Three paths; removes private-requires-selfhost claim and unrealistic two-minute setup promise. |
| Comparison FAQ | `apps/web/app/(landing)/vs-coderabbit/page.tsx`, `vs-greptile/page.tsx` | Octopus's three connection options. No new competitor capability claims. |
| Search | `apps/web/app/(landing)/docs/docs-search.tsx` | Includes private, LAN, VPN, connector, public and HTTPS keywords. |
| Public assistant and full LLM text | `apps/web/lib/docs-content.ts`, `apps/web/app/api/ask-octopus/route.ts`, generated `apps/web/app/llms-full.txt/route.ts` | Separate connection paths and actual connector setup; no self-host-only answer for Cloud private users. |
| LLM index | `apps/web/public/llms.txt` | Separate Cloud private and self-hosted direct links; clear Cloud processing statement. |
| Welcome, getting-started and reminder emails | `apps/web/lib/email-template-seeds.ts` | All three Forgejo options, chooser links and Cloud data-flow disclosure. |
| Existing email templates | `packages/db/prisma/migrations/20260919213000_forgejo_connector_email_templates/migration.sql` | Updates only exact v1.1.0 default system-template bodies. Custom content, sender, subject, enabled state and delivery preferences remain intact. No emails are sent. |
| Privacy, security and retention | `apps/web/app/(landing)/docs/privacy/page.tsx`, `docs/security-overview/page.tsx`, `docs/data-retention/page.tsx` | Distinguishes local Forgejo token from hashed connector credential; discloses encrypted transport storage, cleanup and backup limits. |
| Release notes | `CHANGELOG.md` | Customer-facing connector behavior and upgrade instructions in v1.2.0. Earlier release notes retain their dated scope. |
| Reviewed, no mode-specific change needed | `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`, `apps/web/lib/structured-data.ts`, login panel, about, glossary, GitHub Action related links, sub-processors, bug-bounty page | Existing provider lists remain accurate. GitHub-only features retain their scope. |

The token instructions account for Forgejo's scope restrictions: `read:user` is unavailable for Specific repositories tokens. A dedicated account limits access to intended repositories while the token uses All (public, private, and limited) with `read:user`, `write:repository` and `write:issue`. No instance administrator access is needed. See [Forgejo token scope documentation](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/authentication/token-scope/).

For direct self-hosted Octopus webhooks on a private destination, Forgejo operators must preserve existing `ALLOWED_HOST_LIST` entries and add the specific target host. The Cloud connector's webhook destination is public Octopus Cloud and needs no private webhook target. See [Forgejo webhook configuration](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/config-cheat-sheet/#webhook-webhook).

## Release follow-through

1. Deploy connector support, its versioned image and content together. Do not publish setup claims before the referenced connector is available.
2. Apply the additive connector schema migration and guarded email migration. Changing seeds alone does not replace existing database templates. Customized email bodies need editorial review; migrations preserve them.
3. Refresh the assistant's indexed documentation using the existing authorized `POST /api/admin/seed-docs` process after deployment. Source updates and generated LLM text do not refresh Qdrant by themselves.
4. Check the live chooser, all three anchors, narrow layouts, Settings flow and rendered email previews. Do not send live customer emails to validate this change.
5. Verify an authorized private Forgejo repository through actual indexing, a signed event, a completed review, comments and commit status. A successful webhook delivery, mocked AI review or TLS fixture establishes only its measured portion of that flow.

## Validation recorded for this change

- Scoped ESLint passed for the edited landing, docs, assistant, dashboard and email files.
- The email migration-chain test passed against disposable PostgreSQL: 2 tests, 72 assertions. It runs both Forgejo email migrations twice, checks upgrades from pre-Forgejo and v1.1.0 defaults, matches the latest seeds, and preserves customized and non-system bodies, disabled delivery, sender and subject. The database was stopped afterward.
- Repeat the database check with `FORGEJO_EMAIL_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://.../forgejo_email_test bun test apps/web/lib/__tests__/forgejo-email-migration.test.ts`. It requires a test-named database and uses a temporary table.
- All three email bodies rendered through the existing `renderEmailPreview` with a mocked database. No emails were sent. Local previews: `/tmp/octopus-forgejo-connector-welcome.html`, `/tmp/octopus-forgejo-connector-get-started-new-user.html`, `/tmp/octopus-forgejo-connector-connect-repo-reminder.html`.
- Real local Next.js docs at `http://localhost:43411` were browser-checked at 1280px and 390px. All three chooser links reached unique section anchors. The private setup and self-hosted guide had no page overflow; the latter linked Cloud users to the connector and rendered allowlist/CA instructions. Evidence: `/tmp/octopus-forgejo-connector-docs-{desktop,chooser-mobile,private-mobile,selfhost-mobile}.png`. Subsequent source edits removed the native Bun alternative, fixed one inline spacing issue, matched the UI labels and removed a pre-existing absolute self-host processing claim; repeat against the final release build.
- The welcome preview showed all three paths, the expected setup/dashboard/preferences links and a loaded logo at 1200px and a 390px narrow browser viewport without horizontal overflow. Screenshots: `/tmp/octopus-forgejo-connector-welcome-{desktop,narrow}.png`. This is rendered HTML validation, not inbox deliverability testing.
- Full application gates, final-build browser verification, actual connector behavior and deployment evidence belong to the release validation; this audit does not substitute for them.

## External content requiring separate follow-through

- The organization profile is owned by `octopusreview/.github`, `profile/README.md`; see [PR #4](https://github.com/octopusreview/.github/pull/4) for its Forgejo content update.
- Ads, social bios, pinned posts, sales templates and launch directories are not stored here. Their current content needs a separate account inventory. No campaigns or posts were changed.
- Blog bodies are database-backed, so a source scan is not a complete editorial inventory. Preserve dated posts and authentic GitHub example screenshots. A new Forgejo announcement or screenshot should match the verified release and actual review behavior.
